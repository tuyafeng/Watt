<i>Watt</i> is an open source Android component management application. It uses pm command to disable or enable components, requires root permissions.

<b>Features:</b>

* Disable or enable components(receivers/services/activities) easily
* Block a broadcast so that no app can receive it to wake itself
* Block the bad Keep-Alive services of some apps without errors
* No data collection
* Efficient and simple interface

<b>Why not IFW?</b>

In version 2.0, Watt has completely abandoned disabling components through the Intent Firewall, because ifw will cause android10+ devices to keep restarting. In view of this poor performance, Watt 2.0 uses pm commands to refactor the entire application.
